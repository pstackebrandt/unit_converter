<p>Humans use a whole variety of units of measurement depending on the purpose or the country. When you need to convert something from one unit to another, it is not very convenient to calculate it in your head. Let's create a really useful application that will perform these tedious calculations for us!</p>

<p>In this stage, you will take your first step in creating a program that converts length, weight, and temperature from one common unit of measurement to another. To begin with, let's simply print some exemplary conversions.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>Print exactly the same lines as shown in the example below.</p>

<p>In this stage, you don't need to create a functional unit converter yet.</p>
